## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADVAIT135/CDAC.git
   cd CDAC/1. Python Programming
   ```

2. **Open Notebooks**
   - Use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Python extension to open `.ipynb` files.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Most exercises require only the Python standard library.
   - For advanced exercises, install required libraries (if any) as mentioned at the top of each notebook:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

- Browse the lab exercises in sequential order for a progressive learning experience.
- Each notebook contains:
  - Problem statements
  - Sample code and expected outputs
  - Solutions and explanations
