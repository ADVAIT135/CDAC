## Overview

This folder presents a series of hands-on assignments covering a range of machine learning concepts, from data preprocessing and model building to evaluation and deployment. The exercises are suitable for learners at the beginner to intermediate level.

## Directory Structure

- Each assignment is organized in its own folder or file. For the most accurate and complete list, please visit the [GitHub folder](https://github.com/ADVAIT135/CDAC/tree/cc4f6b5188b0bdb7c6bf6b663524c611f4de281e/4.%20Machine%20Learning).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADVAIT135/CDAC.git
   cd CDAC/4. Machine Learning
   ```

2. **Browse Assignments**
   - Open the relevant assignment folders or files. Most assignments will be in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format or as Python scripts.

3. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required libraries (such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - If `requirements.txt` is missing, refer to the top of each assignment for required libraries.

## Usage

- Work through each assignment in order to progressively build your understanding.
- Follow instructions and complete the exercises in the notebooks or scripts.
- Use the provided datasets or download them as instructed in each assignment.
